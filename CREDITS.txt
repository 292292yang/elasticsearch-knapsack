Knapsack contains derived work of Apache Common Compress http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/

The code in this component has many origins:
The bzip2, tar and zip support came from Avalon's Excalibur, but originally
from Ant, as far as life in Apache goes. The tar package is originally Tim Endres'
public domain package. The bzip2 package is based on the work done by Keiron Liddle as well
as Julian Seward's libbzip2. It has migrated via:
Ant -> Avalon-Excalibur -> Commons-IO -> Commons-Compress.

The cpio package has been contributed by Michael Kuss and the jRPM project.
